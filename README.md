# Experimenting-with-react
This repo is for me to be able to experiment with React as a framework for a SPA using a combination of components and libraries


The project requires a JSON server or any other kind of database server to fetch data to be able to run the app properly. The command to run a basic JSON server is as follows: 

```npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000```
